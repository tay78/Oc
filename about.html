<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Ezra. Im 17 years old.  I’m a writer and artist who loves building original worlds and characters. This site is a public archive for my OCs so that i can share them with other people. All of them are stories I’ve imagined or developed over time from 10 years old. As a black queer disabled artist i also include aspspects of that in my art and would appreciate if you would not whitewash my characters or be ablest, transphobic etc with them.
The site is actively changing and being added onto and edited since i programmed it myself. Feel free to look around, and thanks for checking out my OC's and art!
