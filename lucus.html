<p><h3> History</h3>
<br>
humans lived separately from elves in there own small villages near where the inner city currently located. the now dry outskirts was covered with magical woods with creatures and plants, one day a  human prince decides to venture into the woods wanting to know of life outside of the village and after days of journey he eventually gets to the mountains and encounters an elf who is out collecting plants for food, he secretly follows this elf back to their town and sees the amazing magical land they inhabited. elves had special powers which were inherited as a gift from god. He wanders into the city seeing these human like creatures with long ears and tails possessing magic which was usually deemed as dangerous by humans, he eventually gets noticed and all the elves were fairly accepting welcoming him and teaching him about the culture. the prince eventually goes home and tells the humans all about it most people don’t believe him, but some go with him on his next expedition to the mountains where the elves lived after a lot of humans and elves going back and forth and intermingling the first human and elf child or half elf is born of the prince now king the humans didn’t like elves despite their years of involvement with each other since the now king’s expeditions due to the king pushing elf life onto humans they start resenting him causing his child to be assassinated which leads to the elves being framed this starts a war in 
An effort to win against these magical creatures they used the magic in the forests and from magical creatures and raped many elves stealing the kids to use as soldiers this lead to the resources dying out and the elves eventually winning and taking over everything forcing the humans to live in the outskirts of now dead forests as punishment
