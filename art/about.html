<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Ezra. Im 17 years old.  I’m a writer and artist who loves building original worlds and characters. This site is a public archive for my OCs so that i can share them with other people. All of them are stories I’ve imagined or developed over time from 10 years old. As a black queer disabled artist i also include aspspects of that in my art.
The site is actively changing and being added onto and edited since i programmed it myself. Feel free to look around, and thanks for checking out my OC's and art!
